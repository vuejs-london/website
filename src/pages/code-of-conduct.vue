      <paragraph>
        Vue.js London strives on being a healthy community! Part of being a community is to set
        standards on how we make our events and surrounding communication an inclusive, judgement
        and harassment-free place for individuals regardless of background or experience.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        We aim to make sure that our community is a safe place to learn, connect, and grow together.
        This Code of Conduct applies to all events run by Vue.js London, including any
        self-organised events derived from our events. We also expect the same code of conduct to
        carry through to any other medium that relates to Vue.js London, for example, social media,
        blogs, forums and chat services.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        To prevent conflict and to create a safe and engaging atmosphere; all attendees, sponsors,
        speakers, vendors, volunteers, staff and organisers shall:
      </paragraph>
      <heading level="4" tag="h3">Be kind and considerate</heading>
      <paragraph>
        Approach any interaction with consideration. Communication and discussions should be
        friendly and welcoming and not exclusive to anyone of different backgrounds, experience, or
        opinion.
      </paragraph>

      <heading level="4" tag="h3">Be respectful</heading>
      <paragraph>
        Poor manners and attitude are never an excuse. Always treat others with the most utmost
        respect, and be welcoming to everyone. Do not speak ill of others in any environment or
        situation.
      </paragraph>

      <heading level="4" tag="h3">Own responsibility</heading>
      <paragraph>
        Your actions are your own, think carefully about your choices and act in a responsible
        manner. We all make mistakes, own up to those mistakes and apologise if you feel you may
        have harmed or offended others. Work to make the wrong right.
      </paragraph>
